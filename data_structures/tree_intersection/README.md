 # Breadth-first Traversal
Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary tree parameters.



## Challenge Description
Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Approach & Efficiency
Efficiency is O(n^2) given the loops to iterate through the tree.
