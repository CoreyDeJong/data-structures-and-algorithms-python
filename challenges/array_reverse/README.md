# Reverse an Array
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. 

## Challenge
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
My thought was to focus first on the length of the array given it could vary. Next was to take that length to dynamically change how many time I needed to loop through that array. Lastly I used the difference of the length of the array and an incrementer starting at 1 to return results from the last index starting first.

## Solution
